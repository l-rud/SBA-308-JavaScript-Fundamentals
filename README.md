**Project:** This project includes the creation of a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification.            
**Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Git Bash, GitHub.                 
**Programming languages:** HTML5, JavaScript.   
         
**The script meets the technical requirements listed below:**     
                
- The variables were declared using 'let' & 'const'.        
- The operators ( + * / ) were used to perform calculations on variables and literals.       
- The strings, numbers, and Boolean values were cached within variables.       
- Two if/else statements to control program flow were included.         
- Two different types of loops were utilized ('For' and 'For of').         
- Arrays and objects were created.          
- Functions were used to handle repeated tasks.         
- Program outputs processed data as described in the specification.       
- The program runs without errors.       
- Commits to the git repository were made frequently.       
- A README file was included.
