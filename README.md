**Project:** This project includes the creation of a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification.            
**Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Git Bash, GitHub.                 
**Programming languages:** HTML5, JavaScript.

- The operators ( + * / ) was used to perform calculations on variables and literals.       
- The strings, numbers, and Boolean values was cached within variables.       
- Two if/else statements to control program flow was included.         
- Two different types of loops was utilized ("For" and "For of").         
- Arrays and objects was created.          
- Functions was used to handle repeated tasks.         
- Program outputs processed data as described in the specification.
